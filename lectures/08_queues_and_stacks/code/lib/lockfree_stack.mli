(** Lock-free unbounded stack (Treiber stack with exponential backoff).

    Based on "The Art of Multiprocessor Programming" by Herlihy and Shavit
    (Chapter 11, Figures 11.2–11.4).

    Uses compare-and-swap (CAS) for both push and pop.
    The push() method CAS-es the top pointer from the old top to a new
    node whose next field points to the old top.
    The pop() method CAS-es the top pointer from the old top to its
    successor.

    Both methods use exponential backoff to reduce contention on the
    top pointer.

    This stack is lock-free: a method call completes in a finite
    number of steps regardless of what other threads do. *)

type 'a t
(** The type of a lock-free stack containing elements of type ['a]. *)

exception Empty
(** Raised by [pop] when the stack is empty. *)

val create : unit -> 'a t
(** [create ()] creates a new empty lock-free stack. *)

val push : 'a t -> 'a -> unit
(** [push s x] pushes [x] onto the top of the stack.
    This operation is lock-free and always succeeds (the stack is unbounded).
    Linearization point: successful CAS on [top]. *)

val try_pop : 'a t -> 'a option
(** [try_pop s] removes and returns the top element of the stack,
    or [None] if the stack is empty.
    This operation is lock-free.
    Linearization point: successful CAS on [top], or observing [top = None]. *)

val pop : 'a t -> 'a
(** [pop s] removes and returns the top element of the stack.
    @raise Empty if the stack is empty.
    This operation is lock-free.
    Linearization point: successful CAS on [top], or observing [top = None]. *)
