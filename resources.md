# Software

## OCaml 5

This course requires **OCaml 5.4 or later** for native support of parallelism (domains) and concurrency (effect handlers).

### Installation

Follow the official [OCaml installation guide](https://ocaml.org/docs/install.html). We recommend using `opam`, the OCaml package manager.

**Quick Start (Linux/macOS/WSL):**

```bash
bash -c "sh <(curl -fsSL https://opam.ocaml.org/install.sh)"
opam init
opam switch create 5.4.0
opam install ocaml-lsp-server.1.24.0 ocamlformat.0.28.1 utop.2.16.0 qcheck-lin.0.10 qcheck-stm.0.10
```

**Windows Users:** Use WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) for best compatibility.

### Development Environment

We recommend **Visual Studio Code** with the [OCaml Platform](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ocamllabs.ocaml-platform) extension for:

- Syntax highlighting and formatting
- Type information on hover
- Jump to definition
- Error checking
- Auto-completion

Other editors with good OCaml support: Emacs (with Tuareg/Merlin), Vim (with Merlin/coc.nvim).

## Build Tools

- **Dune**: OCaml build system (installed via opam above)
- **Make**: Some examples use Makefiles for convenience

## Benchmarking Tools

- **Hyperfine**: Command-line benchmarking tool - [Installation](https://github.com/sharkdp/hyperfine)

# Learning Resources

## Concurrent Programming

### Primary Textbooks
